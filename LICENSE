The MIT License starts with a copyright from 2025, by Gevonda108.

It gives permission to anyone who gets a copy of the software, along with its documentation files. That means dealing with the software in pretty much any way, without limits really. Like, you can use it, copy it, modify things, merge it into other projects, publish it somewhere, distribute copies, sublicense it, or even sell them. And if you pass the software to someone else, they can do all that too.

But theres this condition. You have to include the copyright notice up top and the permission notice in every copy, or at least in any substantial parts of the software.

The software comes as is. No warranty at all, whether express or implied. That covers stuff like merchantability, or if its fit for a particular purpose, and noninfringement too. I think that means it might not work perfectly for what you need, or could step on someone elses rights somehow.

In no case are the authors or copyright holders liable for claims, damages, or any other issues. Not in contract, tort, or whatever else. All that comes from using the software or dealing with it in other ways.

It feels like this license is meant to be straightforward, but the liability part gets a bit heavy. Some might see it as very permissive, others worry about the no warranty thing.
